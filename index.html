                You know I adore you, I'm crazier for you</br>
Than I was at 16, lost in a film scene </br>
Waving homecoming queens, marching band playing</br>
I'm lost in the lights</br>
American glory faded before me</br>
Now I'm feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress</br>
Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard</br>
And ran for my life (ah)</br>
No cameras catch my pageant smile</br>
I counted days, I counted miles</br>
To see you there, to see you there</br>
It's been a long time coming, but</br>
It's you and me, that's my whole world</br>
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" (okay)</br>
The whole school is rolling fake dice</br>
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes</br>
It's you and me, there's nothing like this</br>
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (okay)</br>
We're so sad, we paint the town blue</br>
Voted most likely to run away with you</br>
My team is losing, battered and bruising</br>
I see the high fives between the bad guys</br>
Leave with my head hung, you are the only one</br>
Who seems to care</br>
American stories burning before me</br>
I'm feeling helpless, the damsels are depressed</br>
Boys will be boys then, where are the wise men?</br>
Darling, I'm scared (ah)</br>
No cameras catch my muffled cries</br>
I counted days, I counted miles</br>
To see you there, to see you there</br>
And now the storm is coming, but</br>
It's you and me, that's my whole world</br>
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" (okay)</br>
The whole school is rolling fake dice</br>
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes</br>
It's you and me, there's nothing like this</br>
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (okay)</br>
We're so sad, we paint the town blue</br>
Voted most likely to run away with you</br>
And I don't want you to (go), I don't really wanna (fight)</br>
'Cause nobody's gonna (win), I think you should come home</br>
And I don't want you to (go), I don't really wanna (fight)</br>
'Cause nobody's gonna (win), I think you should come home</br>
And I don't want you to (go), I don't really wanna (fight)</br>
'Cause nobody's gonna (win), just thought you should know</br>
And I'll never let you (go) 'cause I know this is a (fight)</br>
That someday we're gonna (win)</br>
It's you and me, that's my whole world</br>
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl"</br>
Oh, I just thought you should know (you should know)</br>
It's you and me, there's nothing like this (like this)</br>
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (okay)</br>
We're so sad, we paint the town blue (paint it blue)</br>
Voted most likely to run away with you</br>
And I don't want you to (go), I don't really wanna (fight)</br>
'Cause nobody's gonna (win), I think you should come home</br>
And I'll never let you (go) 'cause I know this is a (fight)</br>
That someday we're gonna (win), just thought you should know</br>
It's you and me, that's my whole world</br>
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl"</br>
She's a bad, bad girl
